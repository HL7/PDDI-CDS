This profile sets minimum expectations for searching for and fetching information associated with a practitioner. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the practitioner resource when using this profile.

**Background & Scope**

A practitioner is a person who is directly or indirectly involved in the provisioning of healthcare.

This profile constrains the cardinality of a number of attributes of the practitioner resource such that they are required, including `practitioner.active`, `practitioner.name`, `practitioner.gender`, and `practitioner.birthDate`. It also adds optional extensions to describe endpoints and digital certificates associated with a practitioner, accessibility options offered by a practitioner (e.g. cultural competence), a practitioner's spoken language proficiency, and additional information about their qualifications (i.e. where the qualification is valid and current/historical information about the qualification's status).

**Examples:**

The following are example uses for the vhdir-practitioner profile:

-  [George Washington MD, a cardiologist](Practitioner-practitioner1.html)
