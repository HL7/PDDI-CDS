This profile sets minimum expectations for searching for and fetching information associated with a care team. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the CareTeam resource when using this profile.

**Background & Scope**

A care team consists of the providers and/or organizations responsible for the care of a patient. It is defined not as a collection of individuals and organizations, but as a collection of roles; each member of a care team is represented through an associated role. Therefore, this profile removes references to practitioner and organization resources in `careTeam.member` and adds references to practitionerRole and organizationRole. For example, Dr. Smith (an individual) does not participate on a care team. Rather, Dr. Smith in his role as a provider at Acme Hospital participates on a care team.

A care team may be functionally "empty," i.e. the roles on the care team are not filled by individuals or organizations. For example, a care team may be comprised of a primary care provider, care coordinator, and specialist without indicating the individuals filling those roles. This enables entities to describe existing care teams while masking the identity of the individuals/organizations that are involved, or to represent standing care teams that are filled on an ad hoc basis in response to a condition/event.

This profile removes `careTeam.subject`, `careTeam.context`, `careTeam.reasonReference`, and references to patient and relatedPerson resources in `careTeam.member` because maintaining patient information is out of scope for this implementation guide. It also constrains the number of organizations responsible for managing a care team to one.
