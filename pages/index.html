<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
<p>
This implementation guide was developed for potential drug-drug interaction (PDDI) clinical decision support (CDS). It was developed by the Clinical Decision Support Work Group in collaboration with University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Wolters Kluwer Health. The project focused on developing standardized and shareable artifacts to contextualize PDDIs.
</p>

<h3>
Scope
</h3>
<p>
This implementation guide is for PDDI CDS. The guide specifies both a knowledge representation format for PDDI logic and CDS services. Specifically, the implementation guide includes specifications for:

<ol>
<li>How to represent PDDI logic in CQL and evidence in computational format using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning module.
</li>
<li>How to use CDS Hooks as a mechanism for EHRs to request PDDI CDS from CDS services.
</li>
</ol>
