This profile sets minimum expectations for searching for and fetching information associated with a healthcare provider insurance network. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the network resource when using this profile.

**Background & Scope**

As used in this implementation guide, "network" primarily refers to a healthcare provider insurance network (although the resource could potentially be used to describe other types of healthcare networks as well, such as a health information exchange network). A healthcare provider insurance network is an aggregation of organizations and individuals that deliver a set of services across a geography through health insurance products/plans. A network is typically owned by a payer.

The network resource consists of descriptive information about a network, such as its name & aliases, identifiers, address, contact information, the period during which it exists, who it is owned by, coverage area, endpoints (e.g. for accessing information about the network), and a type (e.g. PPO, HMO, dental, vision)

**Examples:**

The following are example uses for the vhdir-network profile:
