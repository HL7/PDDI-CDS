## <span style="color:silver"> 6.1.0 </span> Preliminaries 
{:.no_toc}

This section contains documentation on how to implement PDDI CDS artifacts from a clinical and technical perspective. Implementation details are described using two specific knowledge artifacts as examples. The words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, AND OPTIONAL are used as defined [*"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels".* S. Bradner. IETF. March 1997. Best Current Practice.](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)

## <span style="color:silver"> 6.2.0 </span> CPOE Workflow Hooks 
{:.no_toc}

Figure 1 depicts hook triggers for Level 1 and 2 Implementations. The primary difference in the Level 2 Implementation is the additional hook and defining the initial trigger at the top of the CPOE workflow. The Level 1 Implementation follows the [CDS Hooks `medication-prescribe`](https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/medication-prescribe/) specification, which does not necessarily define the triggering event.

## <span style="color:silver"> 6.3.0 </span> Prefetch Role 
{:.no_toc}

For technical implementers, the intended role of prefetch is to improve the CDS service performance. This is achieved by minimizing network calls by the CDS service to external resources such as a FHIR server. When a client program subscribes to PDDI CDS service, the service MUST return a prefetch specification in the response. This specification identifies resources that the PDDI CDS service SHOULD receive upon request. As is described below, the prefetch requirements are different for `medication-select` and `medication-prescribe` services. The ideal scenario for both implementations and services is to send prefetch data with the CDS Hooks request. The implementor has flexibility on when and how to fulfill the prefetch templates (e.g., data in EHR memory or server call), which will likely result in a solution that reduces the burden of the server and improves the CDS service efficiency. If the CDS service does not receive prefetch data in the request it MUST query the server via network call.

# <span style="color:silver"> 7.0.0 </span> Warfarin + NSAIDs

## <span style="color:silver"> 7.1.0 </span> The Warfarin + NSAIDs Knowledge Artifact
{:.no_toc}

The  Warfarin + NSAIDs knowledge artifact represents a relatively complex contextualized PDDI CDS algorithm. The knowledge artifact contains logic that uses both drug and patient contextual factors. The original rule was developed by clinical experts as part of the W3C Community Group effort to develop a PDDI minimum information model. Table 1 is the Warfarin + NSAIDs knowledge artifact at the narrative level using the minimum information model.

## <span style="color:silver"> 7.2.0 </span> Level 1 Implementation - Warfarin + NSAIDs Knowledge Artifact (semi-structured) 

Figure 2 depicts how a PDDI CDS implementer would translate a minimum information model narrative to a semi-structured knowledge artifact. The Level 1 Implementation uses a single CDS service call and response using the `medication-prescribe` Hook. The decision tree results in three warning indicators (i.e., green, orange, red) and contextual factors that MAY be passed to the clinician.  After processing the CDS Hooks `medication-prescribe`, the CDS service MUST return CDS Hooks Cards that MAY include actions with associated FHIR resources. Figure 3 builds on Figure 2 by depicting a Card display example within the order entry workflow. The decision points, `medication-prescribe` request, and Card(s) response are discussed further in the sections below.

### <span style="color:silver"> 7.2.1 </span> Decision Points Summary
{:.no_toc}

Many PDDI CDS scenarios have similar drug and patient related decision points. Implementers SHOULD develop CQL artifacts that work in conjunction with the `medication-prescribe` context and prefetch to support the base decision points. The Warfarin + NSAIDs PDDI exemplar as three main decision blocks that include:

* whether the prescribed NSAID is topical diclofenac

* whether the patient is taking a proton pump inhibitor 

* the presence or absence of risk factors involving age, exacerbating medications, and history of upper gastrointestinal bleed


### <span style="color:silver"> 7.2.2 </span> CDS Hooks Request

## <span style="color:silver"> 7.3.0 </span> Level 2 Implementation - Warfarin + NSAIDs Knowledge Artifact (semi-structured)

The Level 2 Implementation for the Warfarin + NSAID artifact is split into two separate Hooks and services. Figures 4 and 5 depict the decision tree for warning indicators (i.e., green, orange, red) and contextual factors for both Hooks (i.e., `medication-select` and `medication-prescribe`). Figure 5 provides a Card display example for each CDS Hooks instance within the order entry workflow. In the provided Card display example, the clinician decided to order the NSAID medication but adds a proton pump inhibitor, in response to the card suggestion. This action results in a downgrade of the `medication-presecribe` response card (i.e., "hard-stop" â€“ red to "warning" â€“ orange). The blue task boxes highlight the DetectedIssue `status` indicator, which informs the EHR  of additional needed resources (whether or not to fulfill the `medication-prescribe` service prefetch template), and `medication-prescribe` service if it needs to perform a FHIR server request in the event prefetch data are not provided in the request.

              <ul><strong>Evidence for a Suspected Drug-Drug Interaction:</strong> For patients with a reliable plasma digoxin concentration in normal range, it is reasonable to anticipate an increase in plasma concentrations after the initiation of cyclosporine. Following initiation, close monitoring and adjusting the digoxin dose as needed is recommended. (Dorian et al. Clin Invest Med 1988; 11(2):108-112) (Dorian et al. Transplant Proc. 1987; 19(1):1825-1827). Taken 4-6 hours after the most recent dose, the approximate therapeutic range is 0.8 to 2.0 ng/mL (1 to 2.6 nmol/L); however, toxicity has been observed with concentrations in this range.</ul>
            </li>
            <li>Risk factors that may increase digoxin concentration or toxicity independent of cyclosporine include: reduced renal function and electrolyte abnormalities

               <ul>50-70% of digoxin is excreted unchanged in the urine. Changing renal function may increase serum concentrations and risk of toxicity, (Digoxin-FDA [prescribing information] NDA 20405/S-004) </ul>

## <span style="color:silver"> 8.2.0 </span> Definitions 
{:.no_toc}

The Digoxin + Cyclosporine artifact logic depends on the concept that the patient was currently stable on digoxin before the current medication order. To make this clear, the Definitions section (8.1.0) defines terms used in the subsequent flow diagrams. Figure 6 progresses through the decision tree and includes warning indicators (i.e., green, orange, red) and contextual factors that may be passed to the clinician.


* **Incident Order** â€“ `context` medication is *not* in `prefetch` medications and, thus, is presumably the first occurrence. 

* **Prevalent Order** â€“ `context` medication is in `prefetch` medications and, thus, is presumably a medication order that is continued or repeated.

* **Normal** â€“ observation that is within a specified time period, and the measure is within a therapeutic window or below/above a certain threshold.

* **Abnormal** â€“ observation that is *not* within a specified time period, *or* the measure is *not* within a therapeutic window or below/above a certain threshold.



## <span style="color:silver"> 8.3.0 </span> Level 1 Implementation - Digoxin + Cyclosporine Knowledge Artifact (semi-structured) 


Figure 6 shows how a PDDI CDS implementer would implement the Digoxin + Cyclosporine PDDI knowlege artifact using the CDS Hooks `medication-prescribe` hook. The figure shows that the CDS Service would process the PDDI CDS logic after receiving a `medication-prescribe` request. Note that, like the Warfarin-NSAIDs PDDI, the CDS implementor MUST create *pre-fetch* templates the client programs will use to assemble data for `medication-prescribe` requests.  Data in the request MUST include both the prescribing context required as part of the `medication-prescribe` hook and pre-fetch resources specified by the CDS service. The decision tree shown in the figure indicates warning indicators (i.e., green, orange, red) and contextual factors that MAY be passed to the clinician.  After processing the CDS Hooks `medication-prescribe`, the CDS service MUST return CDS Hooks *cards* that MAY include *actions* with associated FHIR resources.

## <span style="color:silver"> 8.4.0 </span> Level 2 Implementation - Digoxin + Cyclosporine Knowledge Artifact (semi-structured)

As described under the Getting Started tab, the Advanced proposal requires several changes to the current standard specifications. Changes to the CDS Hooks context are specified below. The Advanced implementation proposal for the Digoxin + Cyclosporine artifact is split into two separate services. Figures 7 and 8 depict the decision tree for warning indicators (i.e., green, orange, red) and contextual factors for both services (i.e., Medication Select and Medication Prescribe). The blue task boxes highlight the DetectedIssue status indicator, which informs the EHR  of additional needed resources (whether or not to fulfill the Medication Prescribe Service prefetch template), and Medication Prescribe Service if it needs to perform a FHIR server request in the event prefetch data are not provided in the request.
