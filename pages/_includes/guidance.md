### 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set

The US Core Profiles are intended to meet the 2015 Edition certification criterion for Patient Selection 170.315(g)(7), and Application Access – Data Category Request 170.315(g)(8). They were created for each of the [2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS)].  The Location, Organization, and Practitioner Profiles are not called out specifically in the certification criteria but are included because they are directly referenced by other profiles.  Where applicable the US Core Profiles are based on the HL7 U.S. [Data Access Framework (DAF)] FHIR DSTU2 Implementation Guide. However, the requirements per resource are a subset of those of the DAF implementation guide.


The table below lists the US Core Profile and FHIR Resources used for the corresponding 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) Data elements:

No| CCDS Data Element | US Core Profile | FHIR Resource

(19) |  Assessment and plan of treatment | [US Core CarePlan Profile] | CarePlan
(20) |  Goals | [US Core Goal Profile] | Goal
(21) |  Health concerns | [US Core Condition Profile] | Condition

### Must Support
In the context of US Core, *Must Support* on any data element SHALL be interpreted as follows:


* US Core Responders SHALL be capable of including the data element as part of the query results as specified by the [US Core Server Capability Statement].
* US Core Requestors SHALL be capable of processing resource instances containing the data elements without generating an error an causing the application to fail. In other words US Core Requestors SHOULD be capable of displaying the data elements for human use or storing it for other purposes.
* In situations where information on a particular data element is not present and the reason for absence is unknown, US Core Responders SHALL NOT include the data elements in the resource instance returned as part of the query results.
* When querying US Core Responders, US Core Requestors SHALL interpret missing data elements within resource instances as data not present in the US Core Responder's systems.
* In situations where information on a particular data element is missing and the US Core Responder knows the precise reason for the absence of data, US Core Responders SHALL send the reason for the missing information using values (such as nullFlavors) from the value set where they exist or using the dataAbsentReason extension.
* US Core Requestors SHALL be able to process resource instances containing data elements asserting missing information.


* NOTE: Typically *US Core Responder* Actor = Server and *US Core Requestor Actor* = Client
* NOTE: US Core Responders who do not have the capability to store or return a data element tagged as Supported in US Core profiles can still claim conformance to the US Core profiles per the US Core conformance resources.
* NOTE: The above definition of Supported is derived from HL7v2 concept "Required but may be empty - RE" described in HL7v2 V28_CH02B_Conformance.doc.
* NOTE: Readers are advised to understand [FHIR Terminology] requirements, [FHIR RESTful API] based on the HTTP protocol, along with [FHIR Data Types], [FHIR Search] and [FHIR Resource] formats before implementing US Core requirements.

### Referencing US Core profiles

Many of the profiles in this guide [reference](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/references.html) other FHIR resources that are also US Core profiles.  This is defined in the formal profile definitions.  For example, [US Core Careteam](StructureDefinition-us-core-careteam.html#profile) references US Core Patient.  For any other references not formally defined in a US Core profiles, the referenced resource SHOULD be a US Core profile if a US Core profile exists for the resource type.  For example, although `Condition.asserter` is not constrained by this guide, the reference to Patient or Practitioner should be a valid US Core Patient or US Core Practitioner.

### Using Codes in US Core profiles

#### Extensible binding for CodeableConcept Datatype
{:.no_toc}

Extensible binding to a value set definition for this IG means that if the data type is CodeableConcept, then one of the coding values SHALL be from the specified value set if a code applies, but if no suitable code exists in the value set and no further restrictions have been applied (such as the max valueset binding described in the next section), alternate code(s) may be provided in its place. If only text available, then just text may be used.

#### Extensible + Max-ValueSet binding for CodeableConcept Datatype
{:.no_toc}

For this IG, we have defined the Extensible + Max-ValueSet binding to allow for either a code from the defined value set or text if the code is not available.  (for example, legacy data). This means, unlike a FHIR extensible binding, alternate code(s) are not permitted and a text value SHALL be supplied if the code is not available.  However, multiple codings (translations) are allowed as is discussed below.

Example: Immunization resource vaccineCode's CVX coding - the source only has the text "4-way Influenza" and no CVX code.

    \{
      "resourceType": "Immunization",
      ...
      "vaccineCode": {
        "text":"4-way Influenza"
      },
      ...
    }


#### Required binding for Code Datatype
{:.no_toc}

Required binding to a value set definition for this IG means that one of the codes from the specified value set SHALL be used. If only text is available or the local (proprietary, system) code cannot be mapped to one of the required codes the [core specification] provides guidance which we have summarized:

1.  Send the resource with the code element empty
2.  Use the [DataAbsentReason Extension] in the data type
3.  Use the code ‘unsupported’ - The source system wasn't capable of supporting this element.

Note that when a query uses a status parameter, a status will be ambiguous.

Example: AllergyIntolerance resource with a status that is text only or cannot be mapped to the status value set.

     \{
       "resourceType”:“AllergyIntolerance”,
       ...
       “\_status”:{
        “url” : “http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason”,
       “valueCode” : “unsupported”
        ...
      },
     }

#### Required binding for CodeableConcept Datatype
{:.no_toc}

Required binding to a value set definition means that one of the codes from the specified value set SHALL be used and using only text is not valid. In this IG, we have defined the Extensible + Max-ValueSet binding to allow for either a code from the specified value set or text. Multiple codings (translations) are permitted as is discussed below.


#### Using multiple codes with CodeableConcept Datatype
{:.no_toc}

Alternate codes may be provided in addition to the standard codes defined in required or extensible value sets. The alternate codes are called “translations”. These translations may be equivalent to or narrower in meaning to the standard concept code.

Example of multiple translation for Body Weight concept code.


    "code": {
        "coding": [
         {
            "system": "http://loinc.org",  //NOTE:this is the standard concept defined in the value set//
            "code": "29463-7",
            "display": "Body Weight"
          },
    //NOTE:this is a translation to a more specific concept
         {
            "system": "http://loinc.org",
            "code": "3141-9",
            "display": "Body Weight Measured"
          },
    //NOTE:this is a translation to a different code system (Snomed CT)
         {
            "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
            "code":  “364589006”,
            "display": "Body Weight"
          }
    //NOTE:this is a translation to a locally defined code
         {
            "system": "http://AcmeHealthCare.org",
            "code":  “BWT”,
            "display": "Body Weight"
          }
        ],
        "text": "weight"
      },

Example of translation of CVX vaccine code to NDC code.


    "vaccineCode" : {
        "coding" : [
          {
            "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/sid/cvx",
            "code" : "158",
            "display" : "influenza, injectable, quadrivalent"
          },
          {
            "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/sid/ndc",
            "code" : "49281-0623-78",
            "display" : "FLUZONE QUADRIVALENT"
          }
        ]
      },

####  Using UCUM codes in the [Quantity] datatype
{:.no_toc}

Both the [Vital Signs Profile] and [US Core Result Observation Profile] bind the `valueQuantity` datatypes to the [UCUM] code system.  A FHIR [UCUM Codes value set] that defines all UCUM codes is in the FHIR specification. This guidance specifies how to represent the Quantity datatype when the correct UCUM units are missing or the units are missing altogether which will likely occur in the real world.  

**UCUM code provided**

```
 "valueQuantity": {
    "value": 26.0,
    "unit": "g/mL",
   "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
   "code": "g/mL"
  }
```

**free text units only**:
- If UCUM units are not available then represent units in the `unit` element.

```
 "valueQuantity": {
    "value": 26.0,
    "unit": "RR",
     }
```

**no units**

```
 "valueQuantity": {
    "value": 26.0
 }
```


### Read(Fetch) resource notation:

Interactions on profile pages are defined with the syntax:

 **`GET [base]/[Resource-type]/[id] {parameters}`**

-   GET is the HTTP verb used for fetching a resource
-   Content surrounded by \[\] is mandatory, and will be replaced by the string literal identified.
    -   base: The Service Root URL (e.g. “<https://fhir-open-api-dstu2.smarthealthit.org>”)
    -   Resource-type: The name of a resource type (e.g. “Patient”)
    -   id: The Logical Id of a resource(e.g. “24342”)
-   Content surrounded by {} is optional
    -   parameters: URL parameters as defined for the particular interaction (e.g."?\_format=xml"}

For more information see the [FHIR RESTful API]

### Search Syntax

In the simplest case, a search is executed by performing a GET operation in the RESTful framework:

**GET [base]/[Resource-type]?name=value&...**

For this RESTful search ([FHIR Search]), the parameters are a series of name=\[value\] pairs encoded in the URL. The search parameter names are defined for each resource. For example, the Observation resource the name “code” for search on the LOINC code. See [FHIR Search] for more information about searching in REST, messaging, and services.

### Syntax for searches limited by patient

There are several potential ways to search for resources associated with a specific patient depending on the context and implementation. These searches result in the same outcome.:

1. An explicitly defined patient using the 'patient' parameter that controls which set of resources are being searched by resource type.  Note that all the search interactions in this IG are published using this syntax:
  - **GET [base]/[Resource-type]?patient=24342{&otherparameters}**
   - There are several variations to this syntax which are listed below:

        -   GET \[base\]/\[Resource-type\]?Subject=\[id\]{&other parameters}
        -   GET \[base\]/\[Resource-type\]?Subject=Patient/\[id\]{&other parameters}
        -   GET \[base\]/\[Resource-type\]?Subject.\_id=\[id\]{&other parameters}
        -   GET \[base\]/\[Resource-type\]?subject:Patient=\[id\]{&other parameters}
        -   GET \[base\]/\[Resource-type\]?subject:Patient=Patient/\[id\]{&other parameters}
        -   GET \[base\]/\[Resource-type\]?subject:Patient=\[https://%5Burl%5D/Patient/id\]{&other parameters}
        -   GET \[base\]/\[Resource-type\]?subject:Patient.\_id=\[id\]{&other parameters}
        -   GET \[base\]/\[Resource-type\]?patient:Patient=\[https://%5Burl%5D/Patient/id\]{&other parameter

1. The patient may be *implicit* in the context (e.g. using SMART). Then the patient parameter can be omitted:
  - **GET [base]/[Resource-type]{?other-parameters}**

1. Patient [compartment] based search with a specified resource type in that compartment. **NOTE this IG does not support compartment based searches**.

### Across Platform Searches

US Core servers are not required to resolve full URLs that are external to their environment.

### Guidance on limiting the number of search results

In order to manage the number of search results returned, the server may choose to return the results in a series of pages. The search result set contains the URLs that the client uses to request additional pages from the search set. For a simple RESTful search, the page links are contained in the returned bundle as links. See the [FHIR Paging] for more information.
