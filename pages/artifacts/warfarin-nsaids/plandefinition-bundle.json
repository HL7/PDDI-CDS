The antiplatelet effect of NSAIDs lasts only as long as the NSAID is present in the circulation, unlike aspirinâ€™s antiplatelet effect, which lasts for up to 2 weeks after aspirin is discontinued. NSAIDs also can cause peptic ulcers and most of the evidence for increased bleeding risk with NSAIDs plus warfarin is due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). \nunknown. \n unknown.",
