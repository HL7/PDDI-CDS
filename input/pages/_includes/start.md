## <span style="color:silver"> 2.5.0 </span> Status
Two exemplar PDDI CDS artifacts are available in this implementation guide (i.e., Warfarin + NSAIDs and Digoxin + Cyclosporine). The status of the exemplar PDDI knowledge artifacts for Level 1 Implementation is structured, and semi-structured for the Level 2 Implementation.

> *Note:* The PDDIs were chosen for level of complexity, decision points, and contextual factors. These examples serve as reference for the methodology and procedures that may be adopted when developing and implementing PDDI CDS using CQL, FHIR, and CDS Hooks.
