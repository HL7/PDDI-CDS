An extension to create a reference to practitionerRole and organizationRole under the careTeam.participant attribute on the careTeam resource. 
This implementation guide also profiles out the references to patient and related person (because maintaining patient information is out of scope), as well as the references to practitioner and organization.
Therefore, this implementation guide essentially defines a careTeam as a collection of roles, rather than a collection of individuals and organizations.

Dr. Smith does not participate on a care team. Rather, Dr. Smith in his role as a provider at Acme Hospital participates on a care team. 

This change also allows us to describe care teams comprised of "empty" roles, e.g. a care team that has a primary care provider, care coordinator, and specialist.
For example, the military may wish to represent care teams in a combat zone, but mask the identies of the individuals on those teams.
